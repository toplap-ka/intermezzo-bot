# intermezzo-bot

### This Bot consists of three replacable .sc files:

#### - bot_Data 
The core repertoire of the bot

#### - bot_Synths: 
Instruments played by the bot

#### - bot_Pattern: 
The Patterns playing the bot_Data with the bot_Synths



Feel free to play around and modify / exchange each of the Files using your own branch.
So in the end we could switch branches, to get a diffrent bot every use.
